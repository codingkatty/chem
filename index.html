        <h2>Basic Concept of Matter</h2>
        <p>
            Matter can be divided into two: element and compund. They can then be divided into subcatagories
            atom, molecule and ion, represented by this chart:

            <br> <br>

            There are also 3 physical states of matter: solid, liquid and gas. There are different properties
            for different states of matter, all listed in the table below.

            The changes of state of matter include melting, boiling/evaporation, vaporisation, freezing
            condensation and sublimation.
        </p>

        <h3>Cooling curve</h3>

        <p>

            A cooling curve is a line graph that represents the change of phase of matter, typically
            from a gas to a solid or a liquid to a solid. The independent variable is time and the
            dependent variable is temperature.

        <ul>
            <li>All matter is composed of extremely small particles called atoms.</li>
            <li>All atoms of a given element are identical.</li>
            <li>Atoms cannot be created or divided into smaller particles.</li>
            <li>In a chemical reaction, atoms are separated, combined, or rearranged.</li>
        </ul> <br>

            <li>The atom is a positively charged spherical cloud with electrons uniformly distributed throughout.</li>

        <h3>Ernest Rutherford (1911)</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Discovery of the proton, a positively charged particle.</li>
            <li>Most of the atom's mass is concentrated in the nucleus, which is at the center of the atom.</li>
            <li>The atom is mostly empty space.</li>
        </ul> <br>

        <h3>Niels Bohr (1913)</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Electrons move around the nucleus in fixed shells.</li>
            <li>Each shell has a fixed radius from the nucleus.</li>
            <li>Electrons in each shell have their own fixed energy levels.</li>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            The development of the atomic model illustrates the progression of scientific thought and
            experimentation. Each model built upon the previous one, leading to a more comprehensive
            understanding of atomic structure and behavior.

        <h2>Structure of Atom</h2>

        <p>
            Neils Bohr suggested there is an energy level for each electron that occupy the orbits.
            So, there's a maximum number of electrons for each shell. Here's a visual representation
            of an atomic structure of an atom with maximum electrons.
        </p>

        <img src="chart2.PNG">

        <p>
            Beside it is the standard representation of a atom, where <b>'Z'</b> refers to symbol of
            element, <b>'x'</b> for nucleon number and <b>'y'</b> for proton number. Other than that,
            the electrons on the outermost shell of the atom is also known as valance electron, which
            can tell its group number.
        </p>

        <h3>Proton number and nucleon number</h3>

        <p>
            To find proton number, nucleon number, neutron number and so on, a few equations can
            be used:
        <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proton number = Number of proton</pre>
        <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nucleon number = Number of protons + Number of neutrons</pre>
